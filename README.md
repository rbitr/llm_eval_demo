# llm_eval_demo

Framework and examples for computing "features" from LLM responses to a list of prompts.

Usage (see test.py):

```python
# test.py
from evaluate import HF_LLM, Eval, NumberOfSentences, BigramFreq

with open("prompts.txt") as f:
    prompts = f.readlines()

features = [NumberOfSentences(), BigramFreq(("rolling", "hills"))]

llm = HF_LLM(model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
             max_tokens=128,
             temperature=1)

# run the rilling hills bigram only on prompts about a story
llm_eval = Eval(llm, prompts=prompts, evals=features, filters=["", "story"])

print(llm_eval.inference(2))
print(llm_eval.compute_features())
```

Example
```bash
$ python test.py

She was known for her love of learning and her kindness to others.\n\nOne day, while exploring the village, she stumbled upon a small, ancient library. The shelves were empty except for a few dusty books that looked worn from years of use. As she reached for one of them, a figure appeared before her - a man with graying hair and a stern expression.\n\n"Hello, little girl," said the old man, "I am Old Man Reed.
